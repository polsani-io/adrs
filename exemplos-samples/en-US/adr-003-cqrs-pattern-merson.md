# ADR 003: Use a CQRS Pattern
We have a microservice architecture with several REST services that would need to read and write data. 
Sometimes it's difficult to design those services to do both tasks efficiently.
In the Farmacy Food system, the design of writes (commands) is primarily concerned with the integrity of data and business rules, 
whereas the design of reads (queries) has performance (response time) as a key requirement. 

## Decision 
We will use the [CQRS pattern](https://udidahan.com/2009/12/09/clarified-cqrs/) applied to microservices with this design:  
- an independently deployed service takes care queries. It reads data from a query view that is optimized for data reads.
("Optimized" means using DB technologies and techniques that favor performance, such as: NoSQL, desnormalized view, memory cache, sharding, replication.)  
- an independently deployed service takes care of commands. It may be a REST service that gets POST commands or a reactive service
that subscribes to a pub-sub topic and gets messages that updates the master database for the scope of that service. 
- a batch component (example: K8S cron job or logic activated by database-triggered events) synchronizes the data between 
the master database and the query views. The frequency of data synchronization varies--it can be trigger-based, 
every 5 minuts, every hour, ..., once a day, etc.   

In our design, we have used CQRS for:
- Inventory
- Orders
- Subscription

## Rationale 
We expect that the app will issue far more query requests than commands. For example, the inventory is checked in many customer
 operations, such as looking at a catalog meal item. 
The [CQRS pattern](https://udidahan.com/2009/12/09/clarified-cqrs/) is used to address performance (response time) 
requirements on queries. 

## Status
Proposed 

## Consequences
- The CQRS pattern uses data replication for query views and hence *eventual consistency*. Therefore, query services may
 operate on stale data (during the interval between data synchronization from master db and query view). 
- Need to monitor data synchronization tasks, with notification and proper action in case of failure.
